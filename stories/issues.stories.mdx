# Logging Issues

**Issues or features with insufficient detail will most likely be ignored**.

I'm excited about this project and I'd love to help you, but my time is also valuable and I'm not a mind reader. **Please follow the issue templates and provide as much detail as possible.**

For logging issues/bugs please use the [issue template](https://github.com/jbetancur/react-data-table-component/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).

It's helpful to know the versions, thoughtful steps to reproduce, and it's **especially nice to have a [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-data-table-sandbox-ccyuu)** when possible or at least your component code. The more details you provide me the faster we can get a fix as needed.

While I absolutely ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ to teach React and help out I simply do not have the bandwidth for that in this forum to help you understand how React State works, so **please** keep the focus on React Data Table Component Issues/Features.

Bottom line, **if you submit a ticket with cryptic, little, or no details it will go unanswered.**

# Features

When submitting a feature please make sure that you put detailed thought into the design. Just becuase you submit a PR does not mean it will be merged.

Please provide some use cases, examples, pros/cons and even better **start a converstaion about it**. Consult UX best practices (I tend to stick to material design principles for UX descisions).

Convince me/users of this library that your awesome new feature will benefit all users of this library.

That being said, like you, **I am quite busy**. If you want a feature please first check that an existing issue does not already exist and if you want it now then submit a PR.

If you are submitting a PR that's awesome! But keep in mind that if it does not fit with the design or you are unresponsive to feedback it will likely not get merged. If you have an idea for a PR that is a little more complex, then it should be a feature request first that can perhaps be discussed prior to implementation so you don't waste your time working on a PR that may never get merged.
