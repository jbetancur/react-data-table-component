# Logging Issues

**Issues or features with insufficient detail will most likely be ignored/unanswered**.

I'm excited about this project and I want to help you, but my time is also valuable and I'm not a mind reader. **Please follow the issue templates and provide as much detail as possible.**

For logging issues/bugs please use the [issue template](https://github.com/jbetancur/react-data-table-component/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).

It's helpful to know the versions, steps to reproduce, and it's **especially nice to have a [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-data-table-sandbox-ccyuu)** when possible or at least your component code. The more details you provide me the faster we can get a fix as needed.

While I absolutely ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ to teach React I simply do not have the bandwidth for that in this forum to help you understand how React State works, so **please keep the focus on React Data Table Component** Issues/Features.

# Features

When submitting a feature please make sure that you put detailed thought into the design. Please provide some use cases, examples, pros/cons and even better **start a converstaion about it**.
Consult UX best practices (I tend to stick to material design principles for UX descisions).

Convince me/users of this library that your awesome new feature will benefit all users of this library.

# Pull Requests

First off, if you are submitting a PR that's awesome! PR's are encouraged! But, just becuase you submit a PR does not mean it will be merged if it does not fit with the design or you are unresponsive to feedback.

If you have an idea for a PR that is a little more complex, then it **should be a feature request first** that can perhaps be discussed prior to implementation so you don't waste your time working on a PR that may never get merged.

Aside from implementation details, a lack of detailed explanation, improper linting/formatting, or missing/invalid tests will result in a PR being declined.

# Housekeeping Bot
