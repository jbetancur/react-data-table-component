# Remote Pagination

To enable remote/manual pagination you'll need to add the `paginationServer` property and ensure the remote API you are using supports pagination metadata.

You'll also need to implement the `onChangeRowsPerPage`, and `onChangePage` callbacks.

Finally, you'll need to keep track of your total rows using `paginationTotalRows`. This should be obtained from the remote API you are calling from to get the pagnination records.

The following covers a working example of remote pagniation:

<Canvas>
	<Story id="pagination-remote--remote" />
</Canvas>
