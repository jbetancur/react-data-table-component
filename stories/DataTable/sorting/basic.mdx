# Sorting

Enabling Sorting in React Data Table is easy. Simply add the `sortable` prop to any column definition you want to be sortable. Also make sure a `selector` has been defined.

```js
const columns = [
	{
		name: 'Title',
		selector: row => row.title,
		sortable: true,
	},
	{
		name: 'Director',
		selector: row => row.director,
		sortable: true,
	},
	{
		name: 'Year',
		selector: row => row.year,
		sortable: true,
	},
];
```
