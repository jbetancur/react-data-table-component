# Column Definitions API

| Property							| Type   | Required | Example                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------|--------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id										| string or number | no | RDT will auto generate an id for each column as: 1,2,3..., but you can provide your own id's if you wish as long as each column id is unique. When developing an SSR app you may encounder an `id did not match` warning. In this case, you must explicitly set the `id` to fix the warning |
| name									| string, component or number | no | The display name of our Column e.g. 'Name' |
| selector							| `(row, index) => {}` | no | A `selector` is required anytime you want to display data but can be omitted if your column does not require showing data (e.g. an actions column) |
| format								| `(row, index) => {}` | no | Applies formatting to the selector e.g. `row => moment(row.timestamp).format('lll')` without changing the actual selector value |
| sortable							| boolean | no | If the column is sortable.<br /><br />**Note:** `selector` is required for the column to sort                                                            |
| cell									| `(row, index, column, id) => {}` | no | `cell` lets you replace a table cell with your own custom component.<br /><br />If you are using properties such as: `onRowClicked`, `onRowDoubleClicked`, `expandOnRowClicked` or `expandOnRowDoubleClicked` then click events will be ignored when clicking on your custom cell.<br /><br />To allow `RowClicked` events you can add `data-tag="allowRowEvents"` to your custom cell component elements. <br />If your custom cell component is more complex and has nested elements you want to add `data-tag="allowRowEvents"` to the innermost element or on every element you want to propagate the click event to.<br /><br /> **Note:** that using `cell` negates `format` |
| grow									| number | no | [flex-grow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow) of the column. This is useful if you want a column to take up more width than its relatives (without having to set widths explicitly).  this will be affected by other columns where you have explicitly set widths |
| width									| string | no | Give the column a fixed width |
| minWidth							| string | no | Give the column a minWidth |
| maxWidth							| string | no | Give the column a maxWidth |
| right									| boolean | no | Right aligns the content in the cell. useful for numbers |
| center								| boolean | no | Center aligns the content in the cell |
| compact								| boolean | no | Sets cell padding to 0 |
| ignoreRowClick				| boolean | no | Prevents the `onRowClicked` and `onRowDoubleClicked` event from being passed on the specific TableCell column. This is **really** useful for a menu or button where you do not want the `onRowClicked` triggered, such as when using `onRowClicked` for navigation or routing |
| button								| boolean | no | This is like `ignoreRowClick` except it will apply additional styling for button placement. you do not need to set `ignoreRowClick` when using `button` |
| wrap									| boolean | no | Whether the cell content should be allowed to wrap.<br /><br />**Note:** `cell` negates `wrap` |
| allowOverflow					| boolean | no | Allows content in the cell to overflow. useful for menus/layovers that do not rely on "smart" positioning |
| hide									| integer or `sm`, `md`, `lg` | no | Specify a screen size (breakpoint) as an integer (in pixels) that hides the column when resizing the browser window. You can also use the preset values of: `sm` (small), `md`(medium), and `lg`(large). The default breakpoints are defined [here](#built-in-breakpoints) |
| omit									| boolean | no | omits the column from the table. useful if you need to hide access to data. |
| reorder								| boolean | no | Allows a column to be dragged and reordered |
| sortFunction					| `(a, b) => {}` | no | By default RDT uses lodash `lodash.orderBy`, however, you can override the default behavior by passing in a custom sort function. [defining a custom sort function](/docs/api-custom-sorting--page#custom-sorting---sortfunction) |
| style									| object | no | allows you to customize the css of the cell using css-in-js [style objects](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#style-objects) |
| conditionalCellStyles	| array | no | Allows an array of [conditional style objects](/docs/api-custom-conditional-formatting--page#conditional-style-object) to conditionally apply css styles to a cell |


##  Built-in Breakpoints

When the breakpoint is reached the column will be hidden. These are the built-in media breakpoint presets when hiding columns:

| Value   | Breakpoint  | Description               |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| sm      | 599px       | small (phones)            |
| md      | 959px       | medium(landscape tablets) |
| lg      | 1280px      | large(laptops/desktops)   |

# Columns Example

```js
const columns = [
	{
		name: 'Title',
		selector: row => row.title,
	},
	{
		name: 'Year',
		selector: row => row.year,
	},
];
```

# Column ID's

Internally, `columns` require an `id` property. Particularly, if you use the `defaultSortFieldId` property and you want to defined a pre sorted columns by `id`. If you omit `id` from a column object RDT will auto genereate id's starting at 1, 2, 3 and so on... It is however recommended that you use your own `id`, which can be wither a `string` or a `number`.

```js
const columns = [
	{
    id: 'title',
		name: 'Title',
		selector: row => row.title,
	},
	{
    id: 'year',
		name: 'Year',
		selector: row => row.year,
	},
];
```
